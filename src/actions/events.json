For the parse-side (so non-dynamic-import base url issues) I have acorn extensions and customizations handled in a repo ([here](https://github.com/standard-things/esm/tree/master/src/acorn/parser) - MIT licensed). When I compile into Node I simply update the Acorn parser references to improve parsing. There is still some tweaks to do to the AST transforms done by the `--experimental-repl-await` but the syntax parsing itself can be improved at least. One of the things I leverage is the fact that Acorn doesn't need to perform runtime validation checks (since v8/chakra will handle those) this means parsing can be a bit more loose.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-05-09T20:17:48Z","org":{"id":9950313,"login":"nodejs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/nodejs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950313?"}},{"id":"7651922170","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":4303,"login":"jdalton","display_login":"jdalton","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303?"},"repo":{"id":119901830,"name":"nodejs/modules","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/issues/76","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/issues/76/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/issues/76/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/issues/76/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/modules/pull/76","id":320433461,"number":76,"title":"Add tzmanics as an observer","user":{"login":"tzmanics","id":3611928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3611928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics","html_url":"https://github.com/tzmanics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzmanics/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":831666985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/labels/modules-agenda","name":"modules-agenda","color":"0e8a16","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-05-04T21:19:01Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T20:09:58Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T19:54:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/pulls/76","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/modules/pull/76","diff_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/modules/pull/76.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/modules/pull/76.patch"},"body":"Hoping to help where I can 👍"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/issues/comments/387860339","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/modules/pull/76#issuecomment-387860339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/modules/issues/76","id":387860339,"user":{"login":"jdalton","id":4303,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton","html_url":"https://github.com/jdalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T20:09:58Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T20:09:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MylesBorins I believe there may be some follow-up needed for various script hooks or processes.

However, the code and (more importantly) thrown errors\nreferred to it as `path`. The latter is especially important because\ncontext is not provided. So you're looking for a function that takes\n`path` but that string doesn't appear in your code *or* in the\ndocumentation. It's not until the end user looks at the source code of\nNode.js that they can figure out what's going on. This is why it is\nimportant that the names of variables in the documentation match that in\nthe code. If we want to change this to `file`, then that's OK, but we\nneed to do it in the source code and error messages too, not just in the\ndocs.
