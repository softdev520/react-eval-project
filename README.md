# JavaScript: React Evaluation Project

The purpose of this project is to allow us to evaluate your competency with `JavaScript` using React.  Your `JavaScript` level (not your React) is of utmost value to us when we make a decision on a possible future team member.

We would like you to create a mini data visualization app.  This app should create meaningful content for your Github data.  If you do not have enough data in your GitHub account to work with, please use the GitHub data from any developer you follow and make sure to call it out as theirs.

## Setup

1. Fork this project

## Mandatory Tech Stack

You must correctly use these in your project:

- [ ] Use react
- [ ] Use redux

**Insider Tip:** We are quite particular when it comes to redux.  Be purposeful in what you do.

## Tech we use

- D3 for data visualizations.
- CSS and Greensock for animations

## Pre submission

- Add this project to **your** GitHub account and send us... actually go test it again and then send us the link.
- Your project must pass the eslint provided in cc-react-scripts.
- Remember this is your first impression with us.

# Good luck and hope to see you soon
