# JavaScript: React Evaluation Project

The purpose of this project is to allow us to evaluate your competency with `JavaScript` using React.  Your `JavaScript` level (not your React) is of utmost value to us when we make a decision on a possible future team member.

We would like you to create a mini data visualization app for a JavaScript hero, John David Dalton.  The app has had data prepopulated into it for JDD's GitHub info.

Work on this for a maximum of 4 hours then send us your code.

## Setup

1. Fork this project
2. Read the `package.json` to see how to run the project
3. The initial redux state is in the app

## Mandatory Tech Stack

You must correctly use these in your project:

- [ ] Use react
- [ ] Use redux

**Insider Tip:** We are quite particular when it comes to redux.  Be purposeful in what you do.

## Tech we use

- D3 for data visualizations
- CSS and Greensock for animations

## Pre submission

- Add this project to **your** GitHub account and send us... actually go test it again and then send us the link
- Your project must pass the eslint provided in cc-react-scripts
- Remember this is your first impression with us

# Good luck and hope to see you soon
